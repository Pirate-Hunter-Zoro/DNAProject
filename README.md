## Project Information
*This project implements three different matching algorithms to find the closest match of a query DNA sequence to a database of known sequences. The three algorithmic methods are lining the query against each sequence in the database by longest common subsequence, the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm, and by the longest common substring. Once aligned, the common characters between the two DNA strings is counted.*

## How to run it
*Simply open the project root folder (DNAProject) with IntelliJ, navigate to src/main/java/UserInterface/UIMain.java, and run the Application's 'main' method. The application should appear for you in a separate window!*
