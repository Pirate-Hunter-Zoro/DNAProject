## Project Information
*This project implements three different matching algorithms to find the closest match of a query DNA sequence to a database of known sequences. The three algorithmic methods are lining the query against each sequence in the database by longest common subsequence, the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm, and by the longest common substring. Once aligned, the common characters between the two DNA strings is counted.*
